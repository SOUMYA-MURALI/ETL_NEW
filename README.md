# ETL_NEW
updated project on ETL


 https://jennb19.github.io/ExtractTransformLoad/



For this project, we used data Economic Freedom Data of 2019 and how internal factors (income group, population, etc.) and an external factor (tourist count) affect the economic freedom score. The extracted data are cleaned, joined using jupyter notebook and loaded to the Relational Database PostgreSQL. By using the visualization plots and tables we generated from the combined data we have created a dashboard also. Here Github io is used for dashboard hosting. So for this ETL project we have loaded data to front end and back end.
